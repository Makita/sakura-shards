  # FAQ
  who: "Who are you?"
  who_ans: "We translate manga/manhwa to make it available to (1) those who cannot read the language and do not have it currently serialized in their language; or (2) those who are not near any bookstores and do not have the means to purchase manga through the internet."
  what: "What is a scanlation?"
  what_ans: "A scanlation is a translated and edited version of manga. It was started by fans for fans who could not read the original language (Japanese originally, now expanded to include Korean and Chinese)."
  mirror: "Can I mirror your scanlations?"
  mirror_ans: "Yes, go right ahead! It'll save me bandwidth and help spread the scanlations, which is the original intent of scanlating to begin with!"
